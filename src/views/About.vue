    <h2>Why the name grrz?</h2>  
    <div class=paragraph>
      Grrz stands for  görüşürüz, without any fancy characters (mostly because github repository names cannot have them).
      Görüşürüz ist turkish for "see you".
      See you was taken as a basis, because this app should help my Girlfriend to help the lessons with her pupils.
